# Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke using machine learning techniques on a healthcare dataset. The model preprocesses data, handles class imbalance, and utilizes Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to provide predictions.
